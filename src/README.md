# GitHub Jobs

For this project, I have used [REST API](https://jobs.github.com/api).
It shows the GiHub Job lists with job filter and pagination functionality.
And also have the ability to view job in detail.


## Tools/Frameworks Used
* Create React App using [TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
* ESLint
* React Router
* Redux
* Jest and Enzyme
* Axios
* Bootstraps

## Available Scripts
```
yarn start  // Runs the app in the development mode.
yarn build  // Builds the app for production to the build folder.
yarn test   // Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
yarn lint   // To find eslint problems
```

## Project/Code Clarity Rules
TSX files that contain components should be Pascal cased and have a suffix of ".component.tsx"
files that contain test should have a suffix of ".spec.[tsx/ts]"
